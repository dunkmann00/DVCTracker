- Preconfirms & points are separate

Criteria to go by includes:

- Date
- Length of Stay
- Price
- Price/night
- Points
- Resort
- Room Type

Room type and Resort will be arrays, this way you can specify multiple items
in one criteria set rather than needing to make another just to include
multiple resorts or room types.
